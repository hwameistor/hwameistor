# CRD and CR

## CRD

`CRD` is the abbreviation of `Custom Resource Definition`, and is a resource type natively provided by `Kubernetes`. It is the definition of Custom Resource (CR) to describe what a custom resource is.

A CRD can register a new resource with the `Kubernetes` cluster to extend the capabilities of the `Kubernetes` cluster. With `CRD`, you can define the abstraction of the underlying infrastructure, customize resource types based on business needs, and use the existing resources and capabilities of `Kubernetes` to define higher-level abstractions through a Lego-like building blocks.

## CR

`CR` is the abbreviation of `Custom Resource`. In practice, it is an instance of `CRD`, a resource description that matches with the field format in `CRD`.

## CRDs + Controllers

We all know that `Kubernetes` has powerful scalability, but only `CRD` is not useful. It also needs the support of controller (`Custom Controller`) to reflect the value of `CRD`. `Custom Controller` can listen `CRUD` events of `CR` to implement custom business logic.

In `Kubernetes`, `CRDs + Controllers = Everything`.
