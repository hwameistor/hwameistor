title: HwameiStor Capability, Security, Operation, and Maintenance Test

This test environment is Kubernetes 1.22. We deployed TiDB 1.3 after the HwameiStor local storage is attached. Then, we performed the basic SQL capability test, system security test, and operation and maintenance management test.

All the tests passed successfully, it is acknowledged that HwameiStor can support distributed database application scenarios such as TiDB with high availability, strong consistency requirements, and large data scale.

## Introduction to TiDB

TiDB is a distributed database product that supports OLTP (Online Transactional Processing), OLAP (Online Analytical Processing), and HTAP (Hybrid Transactional and Analytical Processing) services, compatible with key features such as MySQL 5.7 protocol and MySQL ecosystem. The goal of TiDB is to provide users with one-stop OLTP, OLAP, and HTAP solutions, which are suitable for various application scenarios such as high availability, strict requirements for strong consistency, and large data scale.

### TiDB architecture

The TiDB distributed database splits the overall architecture into multiple modules that can communicate with each other. The architecture diagram is as follows:

![TiDB architecture](img/architecture.png)

- **TiDB Server**
  
  The SQL layer exposes the connection endpoints of the MySQL protocol to the outside world, and is responsible for accepting connections from clients, performing SQL parsing and optimization and finally generating a distributed execution plan. The TiDB layer itself is stateless. In practice, you can start several TiDB instances. A unified access address is provided externally through load-balance components (such as LVS, HAProxy, or F5), and client connections can be evenly distributed on to these TiDB instances. The TiDB server itself does not store data, but only parses SQL and forwards the actual data read request to the underlying storage node, TiKV (or TiFlash).

- **PD (Placement Driver) Server**
  
  The metadata management module across a TiDB cluster is responsible for storing the real-time data distribution of each TiKV node and the overall topology of the cluster, providing the TiDB Dashboard management and control interface, and assigning transaction IDs to distributed transactions. Placement Driver (PD) not only stores metadata, but also issues data scheduling commands to specific TiKV nodes based on the real-time data distribution status reported by TiKV nodes, which can be said to be the "brain" of the entire cluster. In addition, the PD itself is also composed of at least 3 nodes and has high availability capabilities. It is recommended to deploy an odd number of PD nodes.

- **Storage nodes**
	
	- TiKV Server: In charge of storing data. From the outside, TiKV is a distributed Key-Value storage engine that provides transactions. The basic unit for storing data is Region. Each Region is responsible for storing the data of a Key Range (the block between left-closed and right-open from StartKey to EndKey). Each TiKV node is responsible for multiple Regions. TiKV API provides native support for distributed transactions at the KV key-value pair level, and provides the levels of Snapshot Isolation (SI) by default, which is also the core of TiDB's support for distributed transactions at the SQL level. After the SQL layer of TiDB completes the SQL parsing, it will convert the SQL execution plan into the actual call to the TiKV API. Therefore, the data is stored in TiKV. In addition, the TiKV data will be automatically maintained in multiple replicas (the default is three replicas), which naturally supports high availability and automatic failover.

	- TiFlash is a special storage node. Unlike ordinary TiKV nodes, data is stored in columns in TiFlash, and the main function is to accelerate analysis-based scenarios.

### TiDB database storage

![TiDB database storage](img/storage.png)

- **Key-Value Pair**

  The choice of TiKV is the Key-Value model that provides an ordered traversal method. Two key points of TiKV data storage are:

  - A huge Map (comparable to std::map in C++) that stores Key-Value Pairs.

  - The Key-Value pairs in this Map are sorted by the binary order of the Key, that is, you can seek to the position of a certain Key, and then continuously call the Next method to obtain the Key-Value larger than this Key in an ascending order.

- **Local storage (Rocks DB)**
  
  In any persistent storage engine, data must be saved on disk after all, and TiKV is not different. However, TiKV does not choose to write data directly to the disk, but stores the data in RocksDB, and RocksDB is responsible for the specific data storage. The reason is that developing a stand-alone storage engine requires a lot of work, especially to make a high-performance stand-alone engine, which may require various meticulous optimizations. RocksDB is a very good stand-alone KV storage engine open sourced by Facebook. It can meet various requirements of TiKV for single engine. Here we can simply consider that RocksDB is a persistent Key-Value Map on a host.

- **Raft protocol**
  
  TiKV uses the Raft algorithm to ensure that data is not lost and error-free when a single host fails. In short, it is to replicate data to multiple hosts, so that if one host cannot provide services, replicas on other hosts can still provide services. This data replication scheme is reliable and efficient, and can deal with replica failures.

- **Region**
  
  TiKV divides the Range by Key. A certain segment of consecutive Keys are stored on a storage node. Divide the entire Key-Value space into many segments, each segment is a series of consecutive Keys, called a Region. Try to keep the data saved in each Region within a reasonable size. Currently, the default in TiKV is no more than 96 MB. Each Region can be described by a left-closed and right-open block such as [StartKey, EndKey].

- **MVCC**
  
  TiKV implements Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC).

- **Distributed ACID transactions**
  
  TiKV uses the transaction model used by Google in BigTable: Percolator.

## Build the test environment

### Kubernetes cluster

In this test, we use three VM nodes to deploy the Kubernetes cluster, including one master node and two worker nodes. Kubelete version is 1.22.0.

3. Create StorageClass

   ![create StorageClass](img/storageclass.png)

### Deploy TiDB on Kubernetes

TiDB can be deployed on Kubernetes using TiDB Operator. TiDB Operator is an automatic operation and maintenance system for TiDB clusters on Kubernetes. It provides full lifecycle management of TiDB including deployment, upgrade, scaling, backup and recovery, and configuration changes. With TiDB Operator, TiDB can run seamlessly on public cloud or privately deployed Kubernetes clusters.

The compatibility between TiDB and TiDB Operator versions is as follows:

| TiDB  version         | Applicable versions of TiDB Operator |
| ------------------ | ------------------------- |
| dev                | dev                       |
| TiDB  >= 5.4       | 1.3                       |
| 5.1  <= TiDB < 5.4 | 1.3 (recommended), 1.2         |
| 3.0  <= TiDB < 5.1 | 1.3 (recommended), 1.2, 1.1    |
| 2.1  <= TiDB < 3.0 | 1.0 (maintenance stopped)      |
