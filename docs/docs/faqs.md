# FAQs

## Q1: How does hwameistor-scheduler work in a Kubernetes platform?

The hwameistor-scheduler is deployed as a pod in the `hwameistor` namespace.

![img](img/clip_image002.png)

Once the applications (Deployment or StatefulSet) are created, the pod will
be scheduled to the worker nodes on which HwameiStor is already configured.

## Q2: How to schedule applications with multi-replica workloads?

This question can be extended to:
How does HwameiStor schedule applications with multi-replica workloads and how does it differ from traditional shared storage (NFS/block)?

To efficiently schedule applications with multi-replica workloads, it's highly recommended to use StatefulSet.

StatefulSet ensures that replicas are deployed on the same worker node as the original pod.
It also creates a PV data volume for each replica. If you need to deploy replicas on different
worker nodes, manual configuration with `pod affinity` is required.

It is recommended to use a single pod for deployment because the block data volumes can not be shared.

## Q3: How to maintain a Kubernetes node?

HwameiStor provides the volume eviction/migration feature to keep the Pods and HwameiStor
volumes' data running when retiring/rebooting a node.

### Remove a node

Before you remove a node from a Kubernetes cluster, the Pods and volumes on the node should be
rescheduled and migrated to another available node, and keep the Pods/volumes running.

Follow these steps to remove a node:

1. Drain node.

   ```bash
   kubectl drain NODE --ignore-daemonsets=true. --ignore-daemonsets=true
   ```

   This command can evict and reschedule Pods on the node. It also automatically
   triggers HwameiStor's data volume eviction behavior. HwameiStor will automatically
   migrate all replicas of the data volumes from that node to other nodes, ensuring data availability.

2. Check the migration progress. <a name="remove2"></a>

   ```bash
   kubectl get localstoragenode NODE -o yaml
   ```

   The output may look like:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: hwameistor.io/v1alpha1
   kind: LocalStorageNode
   metadata:
     name: NODE
   spec:
     hostname: NODE
     storageIP: 10.6.113.22
     topogoly:
       region: default
       zone: default
   status:
     ...
     pools:
       LocalStorage_PoolHDD:
         class: HDD
         disks:
         - capacityBytes: 17175674880
           devPath: /dev/sdb
           state: InUse
           type: HDD
         freeCapacityBytes: 16101933056
         freeVolumeCount: 999
         name: LocalStorage_PoolHDD
         totalCapacityBytes: 17175674880
         totalVolumeCount: 1000
         type: REGULAR
         usedCapacityBytes: 1073741824
         usedVolumeCount: 1
         volumeCapacityBytesLimit: 17175674880
         ## **** make sure volumes is empty **** ##
         volumes:  
     state: Ready
   ```

   At the same time, HwameiStor will automatically reschedule the evicted Pods
   to the other node which has the associated volume replica, and continue to run.

3. Remove the NODE from the cluster.

   ```bash
   kubectl delete nodes NODE
   ```

### Reboot a node

It usually takes a long time (~10 minutes) to reboot a node. All the Pods and volumes on
the node will not work until the node is back online. For some applications like DataBase,
the long downtime is very costly and even unacceptable.

HwameiStor can immediately reschedule the Pod to another available node with associated
volume data and bring the Pod back to running in very short time (~ 10 seconds for the
Pod using a HA volume, and longer time for the Pod with non-HA volume depends on the data size).

If users wish to keep data volumes on a specific node, accessible even after the node restarts,
they can add the following labels to the node. This prevents the system from migrating the data volumes
from that node. However, the system will still immediately schedule Pods on other nodes that have
replicas of the data volumes.

1. Add a label (optional)

   If it is not required to migrate the volumes when the node reboots,
   you can add the following label to the node before draining it.

   ```bash
   kubectl label node NODE hwameistor.io/eviction=disable
   ```

2. Drain the node.

   ```bash
   kubectl drain NODE --ignore-daemonsets=true. --ignore-daemonsets=true
   ```

   - If Step 1 has been performed, you can reboot the node after Step 2 is successful.
   - If Step 1 has not been performed, you should check if the data migration is complete
     after Step 2 is successful (similar to [Step 2 in remove node](#remove2)).
     After the data migration is complete, you can reboot the node.

   After the first two steps are successful, you can reboot the node and wait for the node system to return to normal.

3. Bring the node back to normal.

   ```bash
   kubectl uncordon NODE
   ```

### Traditional shared storage

StatefulSet, which is used for stateful applications, prioritizes deploying replicated replicas
to different nodes to distribute the workload. However, it creates a PV data volume
for each Pod replica. Only when the number of replicas exceeds the number of worker nodes,
multiple replicas will be deployed on the same node.

On the other hand, Deployments, which are used for stateless applications, prioritize deploying
replicated replicas to different nodes to distribute the workload. All Pods share a single PV data volume
(currently only supports NFS). Similar to StatefulSets, multiple replicas will be deployed on the same node
only when the number of replicas exceeds the number of worker nodes. For block storage, as data volumes
cannot be shared, it is recommended to use a single replica.

## Q4: How to handle the error when encountering "LocalStorageNode" during inspection?

When encountering the following error while inspecting `LocalStorageNode`:

![faq_04](img/faq04.png)

Possible causes of the error:

1. The node does not have LVM2 installed. You can install it using the following command:

   ```bash
   rpm -qa | grep lvm2  # Check if LVM2 is installed
   yum install lvm2  # Install LVM on each node
   ```

2. Ensure that the proper disk on the node has GPT partitioning.

   ```bash
   blkid /dev/sd*  # Confirm if the disk partitions are clean
   wipefs -a /dev/sd*  # Clean the disk
   ```

## Q5: Why is StorageClasses not automatically created after installation using Hwameistor-operator?

Probable reasons:
 
1. The node has no remaining bare disks that can be automatically managed. You can check it by running the following command:

   ```bash
   kubectl get ld # Check disk
   kubectl get lsn <node-name> -o yaml # Check whether the disk is managed normally
   ```

2. The hwameistor related components are not working properly. You can check it by running the following command:

   > `drbd-adapter` is only needed when HA is enabled, if not, ignore the related error.

   ```bash
   kubectl get pod -n hwameistor # Confirm whether the pod is running 
   kubectl get hmcluster -o yaml # View the health field
   ```

## Q6: How to expand the storage pool manually?

When is manually expanding storage needed:

- To use the disk partition ([Issue #1387](https://github.com/hwameistor/hwameistor/issues/1387))
- Same serial number is shared between different disks
  ([Issue #1450](https://github.com/hwameistor/hwameistor/issues/1450),
  [Issue #1449](https://github.com/hwameistor/hwameistor/issues/1449))

> Run `lsblk -o +SERIAL` to check serial number.

Manual expansion steps:

1. Create and expand storage pool

   ```bash
   vgcreate LocalStorage_PoolHDD /dev/sdb
   ```

   > `LocalStorage_PoolHDD` is the StoragePool name for `HDD` type disk.
   > Other optional names are `LocalStorage_PoolSSD` for `SSD` type and `LocalStorage_PoolNVMe` for `NVMe` type.

   If you want to **expand the storage pool with disk partition**, you can use the following command:

   ```bash
   vgcreate LocalStorage_PoolHDD /dev/sdb1
   ```

   If **storage pool is already exist**, you can use the following command:

   ```bash
   vgextend LocalStorage_PoolHDD /dev/sdb1
   ```

2. Check the status of the node storage pool and confirm that the disk is added to the storage pool like this:

   ```bash
   kubectl get lsn node1 -o yaml
   ```

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: hwameistor.io/v1alpha1
   kind: LocalStorageNode
   ...
   pools:
     LocalStorage_PoolHDD:
     class: HDD
     disks:
     - capacityBytes: 17175674880
     devPath: /dev/sdb
   ...
   ```

## Q7: How to manually recycle a data volumeï¼Ÿ

When do you need to manually recycle a data volume?:

- The reclaim policy of StorageClass is set to Retain. After deleting the PVC, the volume fails to be automatically reclaimed.
- The data volume is not automatically recycled after the PVC is deleted under abnormal circumstances

Manually reclaim data volumes:

1. Check the mapping table between LV (data volume) and PVC, and find the PVC that is no longer in use. The corresponding LV should be recycled.

   ```bash
   kubectl get lv | awk '{print $1}' | grep -v NAME | xargs -I {} kubectl get lv {} -o jsonpath='{.metadata.name} -> {.spec.pvcNamespace}/{.spec.pvcName}{"\n"}'

   ```
   pvc-be53be2a-1c4b-430e-a45b-05777c791957 -> default/data-nginx-sts-0
   ```

2. Check whether the PVC exists and delete it if it does.
3. Check if a PV with the same name as the LV exists, and if so, delete it.
4. Edit LV, modify spec.delete=true

   ```bash
   kubectl edit lv pvc-be53be2a-1c4b-430e-a45b-05777c791957
   ```
  
   ```yaml
   ...
      spec:
        delete: true
   ```


## Q8: Why are there residual LocalVolume resources?

If you delete PV first and then PVC, LocalVolume resources will not be reclaimed normally. You need to enable the HonorPVReclaimPolicy feature to reclaim them normally.

:::note
See [Kubernetes reference documents](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2021/12/15/kubernetes-1-23-prevent-persistentvolume-leaks-when-deleting-out-of-order/).
:::

Steps to enable HonorPVReclaimPolicy:

1. Modify kube-controller-manager:

   ```bash
   vi /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-controller-manager.yaml
   ```
  
   ```yaml
   ...
   spec:
     containers:
     - command:
     - kube-controller-manager
     - --allocate-node-cidrs=false
     - --feature-gates=HonorPVReclaimPolicy=true
   ```

2. Modify csi-provisioner:

   ```bash
   kubectl edit -n hwameistor deployment.apps/hwameistor-local-storage-csi-controller
   ```
  
   ```yaml
   ...
      containers:
      - args:
        - --v=5
        - --csi-address=$(CSI_ADDRESS)
        - --leader-election=true
        - --feature-gates=Topology=true
        - --strict-topology
        - --extra-create-metadata=true
        - --feature-gates=HonorPVReclaimPolicy=true
        env:
        - name: CSI_ADDRESS
          value: /csi/csi.sock
        image: k8s.m.daocloud.io/sig-storage/csi-provisioner:v3.5.0
   ```

3. Check whether the configuration is effective:

   You can check whether the finalizers of the existing PV contain `external-provisioner.volume.kubernetes.io/finalizer`:

   ```bash
   kubectl get pv pvc-a7b7e3ba-f837-45ba-b243-dec7d8aaed53 -o yaml
   ```

   ```yaml
   ...
      apiVersion: v1
      kind: PersistentVolume
      metadata:
        annotations:
          pv.kubernetes.io/provisioned-by: csi.vsphere.vmware.com
        creationTimestamp: "2021-11-17T19:28:56Z"
        finalizers:
        - kubernetes.io/pv-protection
        - external-attacher/lvm-hwameistor-io
        - external-provisioner.volume.kubernetes.io/finalizer
   ```

## Q9: How to Disable hwameistor-scheduler Auto-Injection?

In some scenarios, users may want to prevent hwameistor-scheduler from being automatically injected into Pods.
For example, specific Namespaces (such as system-level ones) that do not use hwameistor volumes can disable auto-injection
by adding the label hwameistor.io/webhook=ignore to the target Namespace.

By default, the **kube-system** and **hwameistor** Namespaces automatically have the `hwameistor.io/webhook=ignore` label applied.

Steps to Disable Auto-Injection:

1. Label the Namespace

   Use the following command to add the label to a specific Namespace:

   ```bash
   kubectl label namespace <namespace-name> hwameistor.io/webhook=ignore
   ```

   This ensures that Pods in the labeled Namespace will not have hwameistor-scheduler auto-injected.
