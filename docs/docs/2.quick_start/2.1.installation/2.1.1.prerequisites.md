# Prerequisites

## Kubernetes

1. Kubernetes version: `1.18+`
1. CoreDNS is deployed

## Host

### Linux Distribution

1. CentOS `7.5+`
1. Kylin `V10`

### Processor Architecture

1. x86_64
1. ARM64

### Package Dependencies

1. The latest `LVM2`
1. For HA features, `kernel-devel` must be installed and match the version of the operating `kernel`

```bash
# CentOS and Kylin
$ yum install -y lvm2
$ yum install -y kernel-devel-$(uname -r)
```

### Data Disk

HwameiStor supports `HDD`, `SSD` and `NVMe`.

For test, each host must have at least one unused drive with a minimal size of 10GiB.

For production, it is recommended to have a least one unused drive, protected by RAID1 or RAID5/6, with a minimal size of 200GiB.

### Network

For test, a simple 1Giga TCP/IP network is adequate.

For production, and especially with HA features, it is recommended to have a redundant 10Giga TCP/IP network.
