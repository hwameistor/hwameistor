# Scheduler

The Scheduler is used to automatically schedule the Pod to a correct node which is associated with HwameiStor volume. With the scheduler, the Pod does not need the NodeAffinity or NodeSelector field to select the node. A scheduler will work for both LVM and Disk volumes.

The Scheduler should be deployed with the HA mode in the cluster, which is a best practice for production.

**Install by Helm Chart**

Scheduler must work with Local Storage and Local Disk Manager. It's suggested to install by [Helm Chart](../../2.quick_start/2.1.installation/2.1.2.deploy_helm_charts.md).

**Install by YAML (for developing)**

```bash
$ kubectl apply -f deploy/scheduler.yaml
```
