# HwameiStor

Hwameistor is a cloud-native storage system. It creates a local storage resource pool for centrally managing all disks such as HDD, SSD, and NVMe. It uses the CSI architecture to provide distributed services with local volumes and provides data persistence capabilities for stateful cloud-native workloads or components.

## Release Status
| Release  | Version | Type   |    
|----------|---------|--------|
| v0.3     | v0.3.2  | latest |

## Modules and Code

HwameiStor contains 4 modules:
* local-disk-manager
* local-storage
* scheduler
* admission-controller

### Local-Disk-Manager
local-disk-manager (LDM) is designed to hold the management of disks on nodes.
Other modules such as local-storage can take advantage of the disk management feature provided by LDM.

### Local-Storage
Local-Storage (LS) provides a cloud-native local storage system. It aims to provision high-performance persistent LVM volume with local access to applicatios.

### Scheduler
Scheduler is to automatically schedule a pod to a correct node which has the associated HwameiStor volumes.

### admission-controller
admission-controller is a webhook that can automatically determine which pod uses the HwameiStor volume and, help to modify the schedulerName to hwameistor-scheduler.
