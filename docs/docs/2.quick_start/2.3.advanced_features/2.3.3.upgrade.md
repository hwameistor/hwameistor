# Upgrade

Helm makes upgrading HwameiStor very easy:

```bash
$ helm upgrade \
    --namespace hwameistor \
    hwameistor \
    -f new.values.yaml
```

The upgrade will restart each HwameiStor pod in a rolling fashion.

:::caution
The volumes will continue to serve pods uninterrupted during a HwameiStor upgrade.
