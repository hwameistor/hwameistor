# HwameiStor

English | [简体中文](./README_zh.md)

HwameiStor is an HA local storage system for cloud-native stateful workloads.
It creates a local storage resource pool for centrally managing all disks such as HDD, SSD, and NVMe.
It uses the CSI architecture to provide distributed services with local volumes and provides data
persistence capabilities for stateful cloud-native workloads or components.

* [App Failover](#app-failover)
* [Audit](#audit)
* [UI](#ui)

### local-disk-manager

local-disk-manager (LDM) is designed to hold the management of disks on nodes.
Other modules such as local-storage can take advantage of the disk management feature provided by LDM.
[Learn more](docs/docs/modules/ldm.md)

### local-storage

local-storage (LS) provides a cloud-native local storage system.
It aims to provision high-performance persistent LVM volume with local access to applications.
[Learn more](docs/docs/modules/ls.md)

### Scheduler

Scheduler is to automatically schedule a pod to a correct node which has the associated HwameiStor volumes.
[Learn more](docs/docs/modules/scheduler.md)

### admission-controller

admission-controller is a webhook that can automatically determine which pod uses the HwameiStor volume and,
help to modify the schedulerName to hwameistor-scheduler.
[Learn more](docs/docs/modules/admission_controller.md)

### Evictor

Evictor is used to automatically migrate HwameiStor volumes in case of node or pod eviction.
When a node or pod is evicted as either Planned or Unplanned, the associated HwameiStor volumes,
which have a replica on the node, will be detected and migrated out this node automatically.
[Learn more](docs/docs/modules/evictor.md)

### HA module installer

DRBD (Distributed Replicated Block Device) is one of third-party HA modules which the HwameiStor will leverage to provide HA volume.
It composed of Linux kernel modules and related scripts
to build high available clusters. It is implemented by mirroring the entire device over the network,
which can be thought of as a kind of network RAID. This installer can directly install DRBD to a
container cluster.

### Exporter

Exporter will collect the system metrics including nodes, storage pools, volumes, disks. It supports Prometheus.
[Learn more](docs/docs/modules/exporter.md)

### Volume Snapshot

HwameiStor provides the feature of snapshot and restore on the LVM volumes.
Currently, the snapshot/restore feature works for LVM non-HA volume.
[Learn more](docs/docs/volumes/volume_snapshot.md)

### Volume Auto Resize

HwameiStor can automatically expand the LVM volume according the pre-defined resize policy.
User can define the preferred policy and describe how and when to expand the volume, and HwameiStor will take the policy into effect.
[Learn more](docs/docs/volumes/pvc_autoresizing.md)

### Volume IO Throtting

HwameiStor can set a maxmium rate (e.g. bandwidth, IOPS) to access a volume.
This feature is very important to prevent the Pod from crashing, especially in the low-resource condition.
[Learn more](docs/docs/volumes/volume_provisioned_io.md)

### App Failover

The feature of failover is to actively help the application to fail over to another health node with the volume replica, and continue the working.
[Learn more](docs/docs/fast_failover.md)

### Audit

HwameiStor provides the information about the resource history, including cluster, node, storage pool, volume, etc.
[Learn more](docs/docs/system_audit.md)

### UI

HwameiStor provides a friendly UI to the user to operate the cluster.
[Learn more](docs/docs/modules/gui.md)

## Documentation

For full documentation, please see our website [hwameistor.io](https://hwameistor.io/docs/intro).

For detailed adopters that have HwameiStor deployed in a production environment or a user acceptance testing environment,
please check the [adopters list](./adopters.md).

### Build and Preview Website Locally

It's a good practice to build and preview your modifications locally before submit a PR to
[HwameiStor Website](https://hwameistor.io/).
You can run the following commands to preview locally:

```bash
cd docs
npm run start  # for english
npm run start -- --locale cn # for i18n/cn
```

### Change Navigation

To change the navigation (left sidebar) sequence, you can change the content in `_category_.json` that exists in each folder:

```json
{
  "label": "Installation", // The name displayed on the left sidebar
  "position": 4, // The sequence identifier, 1 is listed at top
  "link": {
    "type": "generated-index",
    "description": "In this section, we will introduce the installation procedure:"
  }
}
```

For i18n/cn, you can change the nav in `current.json`:

```json
{
  "sidebar.tutorialSidebar.category.Modules": {
    "message": "Modules", // The section titles displayed on the left sidebar
    "description": "The label for category Modules in sidebar tutorialSidebar"
  },
  "sidebar.tutorialSidebar.category.Modules.link.generated-index.description": {
    "message": "This chapter introduces the following modules included in HwameiStor:", // The description before sub-section cards
    "description": "The generated-index page description for category Modules in sidebar tutorialSidebar"
  }
}
```
