# 升级

Helm makes upgrading HwameiStor very easy:

```bash
$ helm upgrade \
    --namespace hwameistor \
    hwameistor \
    -f new.values.yaml
```

The upgrade will restart each HwameiStor pod in a rolling fashion.

:::caution
The volumes will continue to serve pods uninterrupted during a HwameiStor upgrade.
:::

### Remove CRDs

```bash
$ kubectl get crd -o name \
    | grep hwameistor \
    | xargs -t kubectl delete
```

### Remove clusterroles and rolebindings

```bash
$ kubectl get clusterrolebinding,clusterrole -o name \
    | grep hwameistor \
    | xargs -t kubectl delete
```
