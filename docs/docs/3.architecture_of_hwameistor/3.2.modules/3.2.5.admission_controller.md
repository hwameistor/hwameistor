# Admission Controller

Admission Controller is a webhook that can automatically verify which pod uses the HwameiStor volume and, help to modify the schedulerName to hwameistor-scheduler. The specific principle can be referred to [K8S Dynamic Admission Control](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/extensible-admission-controllers/).

# How to identify HwameiStor volume?

Admission Controller will first obtain all the PVCs used by the pod, and judge the [provisioner](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/) of each PVC in turn. If the name suffix of the provisioner is found to be *.hwameistor.io, it is considered that the pod uses the volume provided by HwameiStor.

# Which resources will be verified?

Only `POD` resources will be verified, and the verification process occurs at the time of creation.

:::info
In order to ensure that the pod of HwameiStor can be started smoothly and the pod of the namespace where HwameiStor is deployed will not be verified.
